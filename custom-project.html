    <h2>The Fly</h2>
    <p>The fly is known to ba a dirty annoying animal, however, most people fail to see how resilient a fly is</p>

    <p>The fly is most described to have:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A pair of functional wings for flight and a pair of vestigial hindwings called halteres for balance</li>
      <li>three body parts</li>
      <li>compound eyes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Although flies are known to spread many diseases they have several benefits as well such as:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>They are a food source to birds and other insects.</li>
      <li>They are agents of decomposition and decaying.</li>
      <li>They are responsible for the swahili proverb "nzi kufa kidondani si hasara".</li>
    </ol>
